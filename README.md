## Overview

The challenge is to build an 8-page planet fact-site and make it look as close to the design as possible. Frontend Mentor provided design files and text-files for the challenge, and it was up to the developer to decide how to build the website, and what tools to use.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each planet page and toggle between "Overview", "Internal Structure", and "Surface Geology"

## My process

Since all the 8 pages has the exact same layout, I started building the first one (the site for Mercury) with that in mind. I paid attention to make classes and ids reusable instead of building all 8 pages seperately. First I finished the first page for web-view, then I made the tablet and mobile views for it with CSS media queries. After I had the skeleton for the layout, it was easy to fill it up with different content for different planets.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS media query
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com) - JS library, version 3.7.1



### What I learned

This project was a great oppurtunity for me to practise DOM manipulation with JQuery, styling with CSS, and continue perfecting my skills with responsive CSS design.
